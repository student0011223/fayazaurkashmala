            umm i dont know what to say yr
            <br>
            I know I’m not perfect.
            I know I mess up, 
            and I know I don’t always say the right things.
            But the one thing that has always been clear inside me is this 
            my heart has been yours long before I even understood it.
            <br>
            In all the time we’ve spent together,
            I learned something I never really understood before 
            you’re not special to me just because you’re with me in my good moments…
            you’re special because you stay even when I can’t stay with myself.
            You stand by me in ways I never expected from anyone.
            You see me, the real me,  and still choose me.
            <br>
            And that… that touches me in a way I can’t explain.
            <br>
            It’s not the big gestures, not the fancy things,
            it’s the small things you do without even realizing 
            the tiny care, the stupid jokes,
            the way you talk, the way you fight, the way you love.
            Those little things… they hit deeper than anything else ever has.
            <br>
            aur kashoo ❤️, you do so much bakchodiiii
            but wallahi, that’s what I love the most.
            Because that’s the side of you that only comes out
            when you feel safe…
            when you feel comfortable…
            when you feel mine in a way that nobody else gets to see.
            <br>
            You have no idea how much that means to me.
            How much you mean to me.
            <br>
            You matter to me more than you think,
            more than you feel,
            and more than I will ever be able to put into words.
            And maybe I’ll never say it perfectly…
            but in my heart, there’s a place that only belongs to you.
            <br>
            Darlinggggg, you’re not "someone" in my life.
            You are the part of my life that makes everything else make sense.
            And I pray Allah always keeps you protected, peaceful,
            and close to me, in this life and whatever comes after.
